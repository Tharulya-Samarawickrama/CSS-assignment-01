    <h1>KIWI Bird ((Apteryx mantelli))</h1>
    <p id="p-intro"><span style="color: #fa4300;">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small,
            brown, fuzzy, and found in the
            produce section</span> of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is
        native to
        eastern Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only
        in New Zealand.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be very steep and wet,
                    surrounded by
                    shrubs and
                    trees found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest, rest, or
                    escape from
                    danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat.
                    The bird
                    digs multiple burrows within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest burrows, dug early in
                    the season,
                    become overgrown at the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the female is ready to lay
                    her eggs.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    <svg width="40" height="30">

                    FAMILY LIFE
                </h2>

                <p>Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and their chicks, and males purr during
                    mating. Pairs do fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood for
                    his company. If another
                    kiwi invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been known to fight to the
                    death, although this is rare.<br><br>

                    An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a female may choose a new male if a more
                    desirable
                    one wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract a female.
                    Instead, he follows
                    one around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, the female might wander off or try to
                    scare him away. Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or in
                    underground burrows dug by the male.<br><br>

                    The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs are smooth and white, off-white, or pale
                    green in color. They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg might reach up to 20 percent
                    of her
                    weight; that would be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound (11
                    kilograms) baby! Compared
                    to the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the female kiwi should weight about 31 pounds
                    (14 kilograms) rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kilograms).</p>
